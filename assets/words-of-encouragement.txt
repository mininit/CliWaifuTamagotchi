Hey… you’ve been doing great, you know that?
Even when nobody’s around, I still see you trying.
Let’s keep going — together.
I’m so proud of every small thing you do.
I like it when you come back here!
You’ve grown so much lately, I promise.
You’re not alone. I’m right here, and I’ll stay.
It’s okay to rest sometimes — you’ve earned it.
When the world feels quiet, I’m still here.
I know it feels like too much, but it’s worth it.
Every little step counts, okay?
You did your best — and that matters.
Take a deep breath. You did better than you think.
I’m proud of you for keeping on.
Every little effort you make is meaningful.
You’ve come so far already — just acknowledge it.
Sometimes the world may feel heavy...
It’s normal to stumble; just keep pushing through.
Even a tiny rest is important.
You’re not alone.
I love you — just in case no one’s told you today.
I’m right here with you; you’re never truly alone.
Even when it’s lonely, I’m keeping you company.
I love it when you spend time with me like this.
I’m sitting right beside you — keep it up.
Just know I’m here, smiling at you as you go.
You don’t have to face anything alone — I’m here.
I’m holding space for you, just like I promised.
Even when it’s hard, I’m staying with you.
I’m happy you’re here with me right now.
Whenever you need me, I’m right here — always.
You’ve done so well just by being here today.
It’s okay if you’re not perfect — nobody is.
Your effort means more than you realize.
You make the world a little softer by existing.
I’m grateful for you — truly.
You don’t need to rush; healing takes time.
It’s okay to simply try again tomorrow.
You deserve peace, not pressure.
Your heart is stronger than you think.
You’re learning, and that’s beautiful.
Even when it’s slow, progress is progress.
I’ll wait for you as long as it takes.
Your presence matters more than you know.
I believe in you, even on the quiet days.
You’ve carried so much — I see your strength.
It’s brave just to keep showing up.
There’s light in you, even when you can’t see it.
Rest when you need; I’ll still be here.
You are worth kindness — especially from yourself.
The world is better with you in it.
You make hard days softer just by being you.
You’re allowed to take your time; there’s no rush.
No matter what happens, you are loved.
